            <h2>Our Trip</h2>
            <p class="overview">
               This summer, my family and I are planning to take a cross country trip from Pennsylvania to Santa Fe, NM. We will first drive to Pittsburgh and stay the night, then on to Chicago and stay the night before bording an overnight Amtrak train to Albuquerque. From there we will rent a car and drive about an hour northeast to Santa Fe. We will stay in Santa Fe for six days and explore the surrounding natural beauty of the great SouthWest. Our return trip will be a reversed, with the overnight train from Albuquerque to Chicago, another overnight in the Windy City before heading to Pittsburgh and overnight before finally heading home. It will be an adventure and we are looking forward to it!
