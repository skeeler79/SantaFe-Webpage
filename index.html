         <h2>Our Trip</h2>
         <p class="overview">
            This summer, my family and I are planning to take a cross country trip from Pennsylvania to Santa Fe, NM. We
            will first drive to Pittsburgh and stay the night, then on to Chicago and stay the night before bording an
            overnight Amtrak train to Albuquerque. From there we will rent a car and drive about an hour northeast to
            Santa Fe. We will stay in Santa Fe for six days and explore the surrounding natural beauty of the great
            SouthWest. Our return trip will be a reversed, with the overnight train from Albuquerque to Chicago, another
            overnight in the Windy City before heading to Pittsburgh and overnight before finally heading home. It will
            be an adventure and we are looking forward to it!

         <h3>Getting There</h3>
         <p>We will stop in three cities before reaching our final destination of Santa Fe.</p>
      </section>

      <h4>Pittsburgh</h4>
      <section id="pittsburgh">
         <img src="images/pittsburgh.jpg" alt="View of downtown Pittsburgh from the Dusquene Incline">
         <p>We will stay for one night in Pittsburgh both going to and coming back from Santa Fe. We will stay in the
            Three Rivers section of downtown, which is named that because it is where the Allegheny and the Monongahela
            rivers
            meet to form the third, the Ohio River. It is close to many museums, including the Carnegie Museums <a
               href="https://carnegiemuseums.org" target="_blank">Carnegie&nbsp;Museums</a> and <a
               href="https://www.warhol.org" target="_blank">the&nbsp;warhol.</a></p>

      <h4>Chicago</h4>
      <section id="chicago">
         <p>We will drive from Pittsburgh to Chicago (a heafty 7-8 hours) and stay overnight in Chicago near <a
               href="https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks-facilities/grant-ulysses-park"
               target="_blank">Grant&nbsp;Park</a> right on the shore of Lake Michigan. While I'm sure my kids would
            love to catch a game at <a href="https://www.mlb.com/cubs/ballpark" target="_blank">Wrigley&nbsp;Field</a>,
            I think we'll probably only have time for a walk through the park and a splash in the hotel pool before
            moving on to the next leg of our
            journey.</p>

      <h4>The Southwest Chief</h4>
      <section id="amtrak">
         <img src="images/amtrakMap.png" alt="Amtrak route from Chicago to Albuquerque.">
         <p>Our cross-country train will depart from Chicago's beautiful <a href="https://chicagounionstation.com/"
               target="_blank">Union&nbsp;Station.</a> The <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/southwest-chief-train"
               target="_blank">Southwest&nbsp;Chief</a> train line crosses 8 states over two days, ending in Los
            Angeles. Our
            trip ending in Albequerque, NM, will take just over 24 hours. We hope to be comfortable in our sleeping car
            and enjoy white-tablecloth meals in the dining car. The glassed-in Sightseer Lounge promises spectacular
            views of the mountains, deserts and canyons. Once we detrain in Albuquerque, we will get in our rental car
            and drive to our final destination, Santa Fe.
            <br />
            <br />
            The romance of the rails should not overshoadow the human lives expended to create it and the colonialism it
            left in its wake. The first <a href="https://www.history.com/news/transcontinental-railroad-experience"
               target="_blank">Transcontinental&nbsp;Railroad</a> opened up in 1869 connecting existing train service on
            the
            East Coast to Council Bluffs, Iowa and then through to the West Coast. This innovation allowed white
            settlers to move out west, displacing the Native People. The industry relied heavily on immigrant labor,
            often working the men to death. Tickets in a first class car offered the lap of luxury for those who could
            afford it, leaving second class passengers starving and in squalid conditions. It is important to recognize
            how we've come to the privileges and freedoms we have today.

            <h4>Santa Fe, New Mexico</h4>
            <p>Horray! We've made it to Santa Fe. We've rented a charming Adobe-style cottage through <a
                  href="https://www.airbnb.com" target="_blank">AirBnB</a>
               on the east side of town for six days. We hope to explore the surrounding natural areas to do some hiking
               and experience a landscape unlike anything we have on the East Coast.</p>

            <p id="spa">The Southwest region is known for its natural hot springs. After our long journey, we plan on

               of the Ancestral Puebloans with structures dating from between 1150 and 1600&nbspAD. We are excited to
               explore the caves and reconstructed kivas (ancestral Pueblo homes) as well as see the rock paintings and
               petroglyphs. Definitely not something we'd come across in Philly!

            <p>However, this trip may not happen due to the wildfires that are currently raging in New Mexico. There are
               two large fires currently burning on either side of Santa Fe that are the result of prescribed burns that
               have gotten out of hand. Many of the parks and trails around the city are closed due to extreme wildfire
               risk. June through August is considered the wet season in the Southwest, so there is hope that decent
               precipitation will alleviate the fires, but given that the area is in a historic drought, much due to
               climate change, I am not hopeful. This recent <a
